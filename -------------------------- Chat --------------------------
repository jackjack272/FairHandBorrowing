    -Cristi: 7/11: good day did x, y z,
- cristi 7/18:  register cant make profiles due to id being needed to save the user, but after its saved dose it get and id...

- Mia 7/18:
    - User ID is auto generated as the model is using @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE). if it using GenerationType.IDENTITY, then ID should be supplied
    - Also I suggest the validation to be in controller , not in the service itself, so we can bounce it back to the Frontend and show it to the user easily compared to catching throws deeper in the calls.
    - Implemented login and registration. Fixed the layouts
